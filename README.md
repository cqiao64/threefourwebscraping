# ESAF User ID Automation

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts that automate the task of gathering and updating user IDs for ESAF.

- **Web Scraping with Selenium (`Esaf_app.py`)**: This script scrapes user IDs from a specified ESAF webpage and saves them into an Excel file.
- **Excel Data Manipulation (`excel.py`)**: This script takes the Excel file generated by `Esaf_app.py` and another Excel file, matches them based on cleaned-up names, and outputs an updated Excel file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- pandas

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Usage

### `Esaf_app.py`

1. Replace placeholders like `PATH_TO_EDGE_DRIVER`, `WEBPAGE_URL`, etc., with your actual information.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python Esaf_app.py
```

### `excel.py`

1. Ensure `name_id_dict.xlsx` and `threefour.xlsx` are in the same directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python excel.py
```

## Additional Notes

- Adjust the `time.sleep()` values in `Esaf_app.py` based on your internet speed to ensure web pages load properly.
- `Esaf_app.py` generates a `no_id_found.txt` file, containing names for which no ID was found.
